# Welcome to my dotfiles!

Here I have all the configurations that I use for work as a developer.
It's a repo that is growthing always because I'm a curious guy that always is looking for tools, bash scripts, applications, etc 
That I think are helping me a lot (or only wasting my time ðŸ¤£)

## Tricks that are helping me.

-> $ lsof it's a command for know which files are open by an applications, with this command I know where are the config files of the applications that I'm currently using.

### Visual studio code

It's my battlefield. I started to use vscode when I switch from PHP (I worked for 5 years with PHPStorm) to Javascript.
I love this code editor because have a lot of options, extensions, customization..

My favourite extensions are:

- Better Comments
- Dracula at Night and Jetbrains fleet (Themes)
- Error lens
- ESLint
- GitLens 
- Live Share

I use Victor mono as a typography in vscode:

###Â Iterm2

For the bash I use Iterm2+zsh+Power10k, same as VSCode I like this app because is super customizable and fits with my obsession of minimalism while I'm working.

Special thanks to @codelytv that explained to me this way of maintaining my configs and don't lose it when I switch the company, change my laptop, and so on.
