# Welcome to my dotfiles!

Here I have all the configurations that I use for work as a developer.
It's a repo that is growthing always because I'm a curious guy that always is looking for tools, bash scripts, applications, etc 
That I think are helping me a lot (or only wasting my time ðŸ¤£)

## Tricks that are helping me.

-> $ lsof it's a command for know which files are open by an applications, with this command I know where are the config files of the applications that I'm currently using.





Special thanks to @codelytv that explained to me this way of maintaining my configs and don't lose it when I switch the company, change my laptop, and so on.
